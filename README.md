#### Left to Implement
•	When there is time I will like to add more calculation functions like log, sin, cos, tan and others.

## Testing
•	I tested playing the game in different browsers: Firefox, Chrome, Safari.

•	I confirmed the results are correct.

•	I confirmed that the Simple Math Calculator are easy to understand.

•	I confirmed that the colours and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through the lighthouse dev tools.

•	I confirmed that the project is responsive, looks good in all screen sizes using dev tools device toolbar.
